        <h2>What is The O.C.?</h2>

        <p>The O.C. is a show that aired from 2003-2007. It has four seasons in total, but honestly only the first three are worth watching. It's about four main teenagers that live in Southern California and deal with family, friendship, love, and loss. Seth, Ryan, Marissa, and Summer set the bar for most television dramas in the early 2000's. The witty writing and constant drama makes the show impossible to stop watching and even more impossible to forget after you finish it.</p>

          <h3>Why do I Love the Show?</h3>
          <p>Although it might seem like the best thing about the show is the beautiful California views and the glamorous homes the characters live in, what really makes it the best is the characters. Over the course of the show you see Ryan go from a teenage delinquent being taken in by his adoptive family, to one of the most honest and true people on the show. Every character has a season where you love them, even if they annoy you at times.</p>

          <h3>Who's my Favorite Character?</h3>
          <p>Although she's a little controversial, Marissa Cooper is my favorite character on the show. She's a blonde girl with a love for Chanel, and she always ends up getting put through difficult situations. She has a big heart that always tries to give people the benefit of the doubt, even if they don't deserve it. And let's be honest, she has the best hair and style on the show!</p>
